## Overview
This project focuses on creating a **form validation** system using HTML and JavaScript. It demonstrates client-side form validation, ensuring that user input is correctly formatted before being processed and submitted. The validation aims to ensure data correctness, protect user information, and safeguard the application from malicious input.

## Features
- **Real-time Validation**: As the user moves focus from one field to another, validation occurs instantly.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the required fields contain valid data:
  - First and Last Names: Must contain letters only.
  - User ID and Reference Code: Can be any valid string.
  - Drop-down fields: Include at least three valid options.
- **Sticky Form**: If the form is submitted with invalid input, it will display the errors and retain the user's input for corrections.
- **Visual Feedback**: Icons and other visual elements indicate invalid fields and guide the user to correct their input.
- **Submission Summary**: Upon successful form validation, a summary of the submitted data is displayed instead of the form.

## Requirements
### Form Constraints
- **All fields are required**.
- **First Name and Last Name** must only contain letters.
- **Drop-down menus** must have at least three options, including a default invalid option.
- **Real-time validation**: Validation occurs as soon as the user moves from one field to the next.
- **Visual feedback**: Invalid fields are clearly indicated with icons and other visual enhancements.

### Form Behavior
- If any field is invalid upon submission, the form should reappear with errors highlighted (sticky form behavior).
- If all fields are valid, a summary of the entered information will be displayed, and the form will not be shown again.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: To create the structure of the form.
- **JavaScript**: For client-side form validation and dynamic updates to the HTML page.
- **CSS**: For styling and visual feedback (icons and error messages).
